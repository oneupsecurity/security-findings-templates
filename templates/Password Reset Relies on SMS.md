Password Reset Relies on SMS

# Risk
High

# Executive Summary

The [TKTK application name]  application solely relies upon SMS messages for password resets. Attackers who can intercept SMS messages can reset passwords of targeted users, and [TKTK withdrawal money from bank accounts, make online purchases.]

# Description

The SS7 protocol contains known vulnerabilities which attackers can use to intercept calls and SMS messages. Attackers can also be re-assigned phone numbers of targeted users by persuading telecommunication providers to provision a sim card with the targeted user's phone number. 

The [TKTK application name] application delivers One-Time Passwords over SMS for password resets. This increases the risk of attackers intercepting password reset codes to gain unauthorized access to targeted user accounts.

The following [TKTK application name] application's code handles password resets.  Note how a one-time password is sent as an SMS message user for identity verification.

# Proof of Concept

[TKTK TODO]

# Remediation

Do not set one-time password resets over SMS. Require users to follow a password-reset link sent to their registered email address. Users should be required to provide a secure form of authetnication, such as a time based one-time password generated by an authetnicator application.
